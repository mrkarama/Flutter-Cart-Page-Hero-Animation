# cart_hero_animation




## Getting Started

A new Flutter project.

Hero Animations are not that difficult 
to implement. They kind of sound a little bit
exotic because of the name perhaps nut there
is nothing special about them. 
It just takes on  widget from one screen to 
the next screen and you can define how they are animating.


Requirements :
1) Install Flutter current version Flutter 3.10  or a version > 3.7
2) Install Android Studio to test it on the emulator
3) Package to use
   a) flutter pub add get
4) On your project directory hit the flutter run and you will be able to see the result.
